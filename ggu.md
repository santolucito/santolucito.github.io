# Welcome Class of 2016
Welcome to Guemgang University, the place that will be your home for the next four years.
Guemgang University is not only a place to live for four years, but an Alma Mater.
In America, we say that our college is our 'Alma Mater' - translating from Latin to 'Nurturing Mother'.

In America, alumni will still speak of their Alma Mater with undying loyalty and reverence.
For years after graduating, alumni will return to their school for homecoming.
This tradition brings alumni back together with their old classmates to reminisce about "the good old college years".

To have such an affectionate name for a school may seem strange -
  especially when, up until this point, you more likely associate school with long hours of studying and suffering.
Your friends who are already in college, may say school is painful and they always look forward to the weekend.
So what does it really mean to call a college an 'Alma Mater'?

## Look around you.
Walking around campus, you might appreciate the clean air, or visit the surrounding temples.
We are settled at the foot of a mountain full of religious history and beautiful hiking paths.
The classrooms here feature all the educational technology you could ever need.
This library offers access to more study space and resources than most students in the world could even imagine.

## But these grounds are not what makes Geumgang University an Alma Mater.

The people in this room - your fellow students, the passionate professors, the dedicated staff, and the friendly monks  - these are the ones at the heart of Geumgang University.
It is the community that will be a nurturing mother to you.

Your professors will always be available to help you learn and explore.
These are professors who have sought out the unique opportunity to teach in this environment.
You will be hard pressed to find such passionate professors anywhere else in Korea.
Take advantage of this - because it is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Be sure to also thank the many staff members you will doubtless encounter in your time here,
  because they are the engine that keeps the university moving.

And do not forget, you have access to a particularly unique resource here - an entire order of Buddhist monks.
Many American students would feel blessed to spend time here.
Talk to these monks and you may be surprised.
Just yesterday, one monk was telling me about some results on Einstien's gravitational wave theory.

But perhaps most important of all are your classmates.
These students will become your friends, your critics, and your mentors for the next four years.
The professors here can only do so much for you.
There is a saying in English, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
Your professors will guide you to knowledge, but you must take learning into your own hands.
Reach beyond the homework, discuss ideas outside the classroom, become an academic in every waking moment.

## So, as you move in, I encourage you to consider what sort of home you want to build here.
Your Alma Mater will be a nurturing mother to you, but you will also become part of the Alma Mater.
Always look to what you can do to make this place better for yourself and your fellow students.

Yesterday at graduation, President Han said to the graduating students -
  "In your heart, Geumgang will always be your hometown."
김소월 also said in a poem of his  
  "In dreams, we are always in our hometown." (꿈에서는, 항상 고향입니다.)
So, in these next four years, take it upon yourself to build the hometown of your dreams.

Thank you
