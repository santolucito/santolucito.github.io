# Welcome Class of 2016
Welcome to Guemgang University, the place that will be your home for the next four years.
You will grow here
In America, we say that our college is our 'Alma Mater' - translating from German to 'Nurturing Mother'.
To have such an affectionate name for a school may seem strange -
  especially when, up until this point, you more likely associate school with long hours of studying and suffering.
So why should we call a college our 'Alma Mater'?

## Look around you.
Walking around campus, you might appreciate the clean air, or visit the surrounding temples.
We are settled at the foot of a mountain full of religious history and beautiful hiking paths.
The classrooms here feature all the educational technology you might imagine.
This library offers study space and resources that most students in the world will never know.

## But these grounds are not what makes Geumgang University an Alma Mater.

The people in this room - your fellow students, the passionate professors, and the dedicated staff - these are the ones at the heart of Geumgang University.
It is the community that will be a nurturing mother to you.

These students will become your friends, your critics, and your mentors for the next four years.
You will offer each other a friendly ear in troubled times.

Your professors will always be available to help you explore and learn.
These are professors who have sought out the unique opportunity to teach in this environment.
Take advantage of this.

Be sure to also thank the staff members you will doubtless encounter in your time here,
  because they are the engine that keeps the university moving.


You are both more different than you might think, and have more in common than you might think.
The Class of 2016 represents a great diversity of ideas and backgrounds.

So, as you move in, I encourage you to consider what sort of home you want to build here.
Your Alma Mater will be a nurturing mother to you, but you will also become part of the Alma Mater.
Always look to what you can do to make this place better for yourself and your fellow students.


For an Alma mater is not only a place to live for four years, but a second hometown for your entire life.

Kim So Wol
In dreams, we are always in our hometown.
