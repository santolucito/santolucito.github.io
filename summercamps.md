# Funded summer schools in Verification/PL

One of the most important part of a PhD in Verification or Programming Languages (and probably other fields) is learning about the 'community'. In learning about your research community, some key goals are as follows: 

Having an understanding of the basics of the major subfields so you can converse intelligently with others at your main conferences. 

Knowing what the current hot topics are in your field. You can either focus on these hot topics for your next project, pivot your current project to address some hot topics, or ignore trends entirely. All strategies have their pros and cons - it is up to your personal preference which path you take.

Meeting people who work on related problems. This will occasionally result in collaborations, but usually will just give you a sense of who to keep track of for the latest new ideas. Speaking to other researchers will help you position yourself better in the context of current/previous work.


## Summer School on Formal Techniques

This is an amazing school to get an overview of core concepts in verification (and formal techniques more generally).

## Oregon Programming Language Summer School

This is a more programming languages theory school. It is two week and covers a lot of material.

## SAT/SMT Summer School

This is usually affiliated with

## Verification Technology, Systems, and Applications (VTSA)

A one week school that focuses on lectures, but most lectures are easy to follow and show details on how the theory can be applied to research. They generally cannot proivde travel funding, so you will need to be local or find some other travel funds.

## Marktoberdof 

One of the primer verification/logic summer schools. More popular in Europe than the States, but still has a very strong reputation.

## ProbProg

Seems like this was just 2017, but a nice school run in Portugal on probabilistic programming. There are a number schools on probabilistic programming these days as it is a 'hot topic' at the moment.

## Verification Mentoring Workshop (CAV)

Less of a summer school, and more of a chance to see CAV and learn about the community from the inside. A great way to start seeing conferences before you can actually publish there. I put this in the summer school category since CAV is in the summer.

## And more!

There are many other great schools out there that I haven't included. To stay updated join the mailing lists described below.

# Other funded travel learning events

These are similar events to above, but don't strictly occur in the summer.

## Heidelberg Laurete Forum

The HLF is one of the more unique experiences you can have as a CS PhD. This program brings together an equal number of Math and CS PhD students to spend a week with leaders in the field of Math and CS. Particularly cool because of the emphasis they put on accepting a diverse body of attendees.

## Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (ICFP/POPL/PLDI)

Similar to VMW at CAV, this program allows you to attend a conference and see what is going on with yet having a paper. Note that you can only participate in PLMW at one of the PL conferences.

## Student Research Competition (ACM Conferences)

Submit a short abstract and present a poster to get partial funding at an ACM sponsored conference. If you do well, you might even win prizes.

## Doctoral Symposiums

When you are further along in your PhD (after qualifying exams, but not about to graduate), you can apply for doctoral symposiums which are a great way to get feedback in a small group. Some of the leaders of your field will be at these and give you advise on your research directions.

### A note on post-event surveys

Since most of these school run at least partially on funding from some grant agency, the organizers may ask for feedback after the event. Take notes during the school on things that you enjoyed learning or people with which you had productive conversations. These summaries should be at least one page and typeset in Latex.

# Internships

After you have got to know the ropes, and maybe have a couped of publications under your belt, an internship that allows you to apply your verification skills in the 'real world' is a good next step. It is not a requirement, but most PhD students will have at least one internship before they graduate. Also note, if you get into a company early enough in your PhD, and do particularly exceptional work, they may be able to recognize you with an award.

Internships fall into two categories - industry and research labs, but this is more of a spectrum then a strict classification. As a general rule, research labs will give you more options to publish your work, but if you can find an industry internship that will keep the door open for possible publications that is also fantastic. Software engineering internship are a bit tricky since they will give you less experience with research, but it really depends on the exact group that you are working with and their expectations/goals for you.

Sorted in a rough order of likelihood to publish (based on a vague community perception, not real data) - the following places are know as being good places to do an internship.

MSR
Bell Labs
IBM Research
Haskell Summer of Code
Google Research
Facebook
Amazon (Automated Reasoning Group)
Galois
BlueSpec


# Mailing Lists

Staying up to date with the community is very important. Mailing lists are a good way to do this. Summer school announcements, calls for papers, and occasionally internship opportunities are posted here. If you are not yet in a PhD, there are lots of calls for PhD applicants as well.
