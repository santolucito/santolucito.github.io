# Computer Music

## Do this now
Download the [Syllabus](/ggu/CS102.pdf).

[Install Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/).
This program will allow us to do basic editing of sound files.

## As a class
Download these two music files and listen to them.
[No Church in The Wild](/ggu/nochurch.mp3) - Kanye West, Jaz Z - Watch the Throne
[La Escena](/ggu/LaEscena.mp3) Phil Manzanera - Guitarissimo 75-82

In the beginning of No Church in The Wild, you can hear La Escena.
This is called **sampling**, a very popular technique in modern music.
We can recreate this in Audacity, and we will today in class.

## Do this in pairs
One example of sampling is again [Kanye West](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/12/Kanye-West-Stronger-Daft-Punk-Harder,-Better,-Faster,-Stronger/). You can use this site to find more fun samples.

[Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g) - Kanye West

[Harder Better Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ) - Daft Punk (look around 2:00)


You can [download](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/) these tracks from youtube.
Try to recreate the beginning of Kanye West's song from Daft Punk.

## Do this on your own

Choose a song you like and create a short piece by using samples.
If the song you like is on youtube, you can [download the audio](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/).
