## 4/19

Exam next week 4/26. In class programming assignment.

### Max programming

*Practice for the exam.* You have 30 min to work on a patch using the ```key``` object.
Link 5 samples to five keys on the keyboard.
For example, if I press 'a', Max should play the 'isthatyou.aiff' sound.
Use a loop and then play your samples on the keyboard to create a 45 second recording.
Post the recording to soundlcoud and make the image a screenshot of your max patch.
On the real exam, you will also upload the .maxpat file on the LMS.

After everyone is finished, we will review the ```key``` object together as a class to see how it works.

### Homework
Practice learning new objects and making a patch with it.
Here are some good ones to practice with:

- ```slider```
- ```mousestate```
