## 3/22

#### Listening to your music

You all did a great job on the homework.
Here are a few examples that I especially liked.

#### Intro to Max7

Max7 is a *visual programming language*.
You can write a program that makes music by drawing a picture.
Today I will demonstrate how to make a simple program.

First, [download Max7](https://cycling74.com/max7/).

Then, open the program and follow me as we build the below program.

#### Homework (due 3/29)

Improve the program we wrote in class, then make a recording in Audacity.
Export the audio to a .wav file, and upload the audio to the LMS.

## 3/15

No class today, we will make up class later in the semester.

## 3/8

#### Do this now
Download the [Syllabus](/ggu/CS102.pdf).

[Install Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/).
This program will allow us to do basic editing of sound files.

#### Do this as a class
Download these two music files and listen to them.
[No Church in The Wild](/ggu/nochurch.mp3) - Kanye West, Jaz Z - Watch the Throne
[La Escena](/ggu/LaEscena.mp3) Phil Manzanera - Guitarissimo 75-82

In the beginning of No Church in The Wild, you can hear La Escena.
This is called **sampling**, a very popular technique in modern music.
We can recreate this in Audacity, and we will today in class.

#### Do this in pairs
One example of sampling is again [Kanye West](http://www.whosampled.com/sample/12/Kanye-West-Stronger-Daft-Punk-Harder,-Better,-Faster,-Stronger/). You can use this site to find more fun samples.

[Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g) - Kanye West

[Harder Better Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ) - Daft Punk (look around 2:00)


You can [download](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/) these tracks from youtube.
Try to recreate the beginning of Kanye West's song from Daft Punk.

#### Do this on your own

(Homework for next week, due before class on 3/15 )

Choose a song you like and create a short piece by using samples.
If the song you like is on youtube, you can [download the audio](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/).

I would suggest mixing together a drum track and a ballad - that is the easiest combination to make. Think about the time signature too! If the ballad is 3/4, you need a 3/4 drum track.

Once you finish your piece, do *File -> Export Audio*. Save the audio as a .wav file and email it to me with your name and your partner's name. My email is mark.santolucito@yale.edu.

Here is an example of what I expect from you.
[Arirang + Drums](/ggu/FUNK_Arirang.wav)
