#### Computer Music History

Some early musicians to use electronics in their performances.

David Cope was a pioneer of algorithmic composition. The program he wrote is named *Emmy*.
Compare this composition to an original Vivaldi and see if you can spot the difference.

Black Midi is a type of computer music that relies on using many notes. It can only be played by a computer.

### Max Programming

#### Types

Can you spot the difference in these two patches?
Why do they behave differently?
One is using "Integers" (whole numbers) and the other is using "Floats" (decimal numbers).

#### Hot vs Cold

In Max, inputs can be *hot* or *cold*.
Usually, the input on the left is hot, and the others are cold.
When a hot input changes, the program will rerun the computation.
When a cold input changes, the program will *not* rerun the computation, but next time the computation does run it will use the new value.

Using this knowledge let's try to make a more advanced program that can make music.
We will start with the [program we build last week](/ggu/music/samples/midi_stepper.maxpat), and improve upon it.

#### Homework due (4/5)

Create a program that plays pleasant music like the one we made in class. Make a recording with audacity and post it to [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com). This will require that you make a soundcloud account.
Once you have uploaded the audio file, post the link on the LMS page.

If you like, you can model your program off of [this one](/ggu/music/samples/prelude2.maxpat)

We had an [introduction to Max](/ggu/music/intro_to_max)

## 3/15

No class today, we will make up class later in the semester.

## 3/8

We [learned how to use Audacity](ggu/music/intro_to_aud) and listened to examples of *sampling*.
