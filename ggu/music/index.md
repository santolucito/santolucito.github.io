### Remember!

- Use the help files - right click on an object to learn more.
- Use the inspector to view details about an object.
- You can always search google or naver for help.

### Practice Exam


Start with [this program](/ggu/music/samples/simpleMax.maxpat). You need to add the following components.
- Use the ```slider``` object to control the *velocity*, or volume of the midi notes. The velocity should range from 0-127.
- Use the ```kslider``` object to play midi notes from a keyboard. The keyboard should display notes 41-59.
- Use the ```dial``` object to control the *duration* of the midi notes. The lowest setting should be 100, and the highest setting should be 1000.
- Use ```metro``` and ```counter``` to play a sequence of notes.


Start with [this program](/ggu/music/samples/simpleMSP.maxpat). You need to add the following components.

- Use the ```key``` and ```select``` object to use the keyboard to trigger a sound. Play a sample when you press the 'a' key.
- Use the ```saw~``` and ```*~``` to combine the sample sound with a sawtooth wave.

### Max programming

*Practice for the exam.* Work on a patch using the ```key``` object.
Link 5 samples to five keys on the keyboard.
For example, if I press 'a', Max should play the 'isthatyou.aiff' sound.
Use a loop and then play your samples on the keyboard to create a 45 second recording.
Post the recording to soundlcoud and make the image a screenshot of your max patch.
On the real exam, you will also upload the .maxpat file on the LMS.

After everyone is finished, we will review the ```key``` object together as a class to see how it works.

### Homework
Practice learning new objects and making a patch with it.
Here are some good ones to practice with:

- ```slider```
- ```mousestate```

All the object we have already learned may also be on the exam.

GENERAL

- ```umenu```
- ```prepend```
- ```preset```
- ```toggle```
- ```metro```
