There are two repositories for LMMS projects you can use as inspiration. The first website does not seem to be very stable.

See the LMMS tutorial videos (#7) playlist for a demonstration.

## Final assignment

For the final project you will compose your own song in groups.
The song must be at least 3:30 long (3 minutes, 30 seconds).
The song must include at least one element of a Buddhist chant.

- Direct sample from a chant
- Lyrics from a chant
- Moktak and rhythm from a chant

The song must include a recording of everyone's voice in someway.
It may be as a group or as a solo.
Use audacity to make this recording.

You must use one Max module.
You may use any module you like - either one from the set of examples, one you find online, or one you write yourself.

The final assignment is broken into 4 parts.

#### Part 1 - Due in class 5/31

Create a map of your song (as we did in the homework from 5/17) with at least 6 distinct parts.
Upload a first draft of the song to the soundcloud group.
The first draft should have basic beats and simple voice recordings.
This does not need to be high quality - it is just a sketch so we can get an idea of what your final song will sound like.


#### Part 2 - Due in class 6/7

Upload second draft to soundcloud with high-quality voice recordings.
Use audacity to create recordings without noise.
Take a band picture to use as the album artwork.

#### Part 3 - Due at the showcase @ 8pm 6/8

Final draft song presentation on the first floor of the library.
A panel of judges will vote for the best song and award a prize to the winner.


#### Part 4 - Due in class (10am) 6/14

You will each turn in, individually, a document containing the following.
Explain what your group did for the song - why did you choose the samples, beats and voices?
Which Max patch did you use and where is that sound in the final recording.
How does this contribute and expand on the tradition of Buddhist music?

360 evaluation of group.
What did you contribute to the group and what did the other group members contribute.
Give your team members grades based on their performance.
This will be only a factor in the final grade.

Review of the midterm. You can [download the solution](/ggu/music/samples/midtermSolution.maxpat), or just view the program below.

![solution](imgs/midterm_soln.PNG)

We will form groups and work on a similar project. This time, you will need the following objects:

- ```meter```
- ```TogEdge```
- ```>```

Whenever the meter goes about a certain value, play a sample.

#### Mapping a song

In order to start making real music, we need to plan how the music should sound. Let's practice in class with this song.

#### Homework
Next, we will begin a group project. We will form teams to compose a piece of music using max, audacity, and other programs. For homework this week, in your groups, write down a sketch of the song you want to make. Turn this assignment in during class, on paper. We will not use the LMS for this assignment.

If you were not in class, and do not have a group, complete this assignment on your own.
You will be assigned a group next week.
