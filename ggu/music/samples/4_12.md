### Max programming

*NB* - when you turn on audio, every open window will start playing sound!
Make sure you close windows you no longer need open.

Today we will build a sample player. You can download the [final version](/ggu/music/samples/samplePlayer.maxpat).

The new objects we will use today are listed here.

- ```play~```
- ```umenu```
- ```prepend```
- ```preset```
- ```pitchshift~```

#### First

A bit more on the ```buffer~``` object. We need to understand RAM vs disk.  Disk, or the hardrive, is large and slow. RAM is small, easily accessible, and fast. You can think of disk as a library and RAM as books on your desk.

the ```play~``` object will allow us to play sound in a buffer.
Using the ```umenu``` and ```prepend``` we can quickly load different files to the buffer.

### Homework

#### Part 1  - Due 11:59pm Monday 4/18

Create 10 short samples from music you like. Use those 10 samples in the [sample player program](/ggu/music/samples/samplePlayer.maxpat) we build today. Add ```pitchshift~``` to all of the ```play~``` objects for each sample. Make at least 10 presets using ```preset``` and cycle through them (using ```metro``` and ```counter```) to create a new piece of music.

Make a recording with audacity of at least 30 seconds. Post it to [soundcloud group](https://soundcloud.com/groups/ggu-computer-music) with the title **Recording #3**

Here is an example of you should make.

<audio controls>
  <source src="/ggu/music/samples/sample_isthatyou.wav" type="audio/wav">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

In order to use your own samples, you need to put them in the same folder as your Max program.
