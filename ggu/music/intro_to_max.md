#### Intro to Max7

Max7 is a *visual programming language*.
You can write a program that makes music by drawing a picture.
Today I will demonstrate how to make a simple program.

First, [download Max7](https://cycling74.com/max7/).

Then, open the program and follow me as we build the below program.

#### Homework (due 3/29)

Improve the program we wrote in class, then make a recording in Audacity.
Your recording should be approximately 30 seconds long.
Export the audio to a .wav file, and upload the audio to the LMS.
