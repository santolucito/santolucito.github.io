#### More on Audacity

We will cover the basics of sound waves (sine, square, saw, triangle).

We will learn about spectrum analysis and analyze a bell sound to identify the pitches.

For homework (due before class 3/29), make your own song using the following samples.

- [Bell1](/ggu/samples/bowl-1.wav)
- [Bell2](/ggu/samples/bowl-2.wav)
- [Moktak](/ggu/samples/moktak.mp3)

Once you finish your piece, do *File -> Export Audio*.
Save the audio as a .wav file and email it to me with your name.
My email is mark.santolucito@yale.edu.
Here is an example of what you should make.
