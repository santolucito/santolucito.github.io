+ When you ask 'Play again? choose Y', I do not get to play again if I am out of money
+ it works for two human players

- Indentation is important. use 'ctrl+a' then 'tab' to fix indentation.
- you do not need two copies of play_human and play_human2, just use the same method!

# 201681001

### 97

+ Using objects well!
+ Added suits to the cards (using cool characters too)
+ very good use of betting() function

- printing is messy
- x.object1=myArray[(int)(Math.random()*4)]; -> the suit should be part of a card object, not part of the player
- 'int H = G.nextInt();' variables should start with lower case letters
- do not use one letter for variable names

'while (3>1) is the same as 'while (true)''

+ a lot of really good code and really good ideas, they are just not finished. Some very nice use of methods.

- does not compile
- would need a Player.java - this is missing

talk to me after class if this is your submission - you were almost there

+ works on two humans

- you do not need two copies of play_human and play_human2, just use the same method!

You have an array, but you don't actually use it at all.

# 201681009

this file as many easy errors that can be fixed. Talk to me after class if this was your submission

### 97

+ added suits to cards
+ user can choose between 1 and 11

# 201681020

### 100

+ very nice use of printf
+ very good use of extends and the super constructor!

In this case, you do not actually want to use extends however. If you want to learn more about why this is incorrect, talk to me after class.

could have separated 'two humans' and 'human vs computer' into individual methods for better organization.
