#### Discrete Math

Here are some fun problems

### Room Key
You want to break into your friend's dorm room, but you don't know the keypad number.
The key is 4 numbers long, of number between 0-9, and it takes you 5 seconds to enter a 4 digit key.
How many hours do you need to break into your friend's room?

### Evens
Prove or disprove : the sum of two even numbers is even.

Prove or disprove : the product of two odd numbers is odd.

### 두끼
두끼 is a make-your-own ddeokbokki restaurant. You can choose from 4 sauces, 5 kinds of ddeok, and 6 vegetables.

If you can pick exactly one sauce, one ddeok, and one vegetable, how many different kinds of ddeokbokki can you make?

If you can pick only one sauce, pick 3 duk, and as many vegetables as you want, how many different kinds of ddeokbokki can you make?

### Knights and Knaves

 You visit an island has two kinds of inhabitants: knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You meet two inhabitants, named A and B. They make the following statements:

A: We are both knights.

B: No, we aren’t!

From this we are supposed to derive something about the types of A and B, that is, whether each is a knight or a knave. Notice that they cannot both be telling the truth, because they contradict each other. Thus, A’s statement cannot be true (because if they are both knights, they must both tell the truth.) This allows us to conclude that A must be a knave, because only a knave can say false things.

And what about B? B’s statement is true, because they are certainly not both knights, and since only a knight can make a true statement, B must be a knight. So the (unique) solution to this puzzle is that A is a knave and B is a knight.

The next day, you meet three new inhabitants: A, B, C. (Not the same A and B from earlier!)

A: Exactly one of us is a knave.

B: At least one of us is a knight.

C: None of us is a knave.

Which inhabitants are knights, and which are knaves?

If you enjoy these kind of problems, you can find more in Raymond Smullyan's puzzle books.
The books use mostly simple words - give it a try.
