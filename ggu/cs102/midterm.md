### Midterm project - due May 8, 11:59pm

Expand upon the Blackjack game to include betting.
The player starts with $10 and the computer always has at least $10.
The player can place a bet before they play a hand.
If the game is a tie, the computer wins.
Your game should look as follows.

```
What is your name?
 [Mark]

Mark has $10
Computer has $10

How much will you bet?
 [5]

Mark got
7 and 3
Do you want another card (Y/N)
 [Y]
Mark total = 16
Do you want another card (Y/N)
 [N]
Computer player got
9 and 7
Computer Wins $10
Mark Loses $5

Mark has $5
Computer has $15

Play again?
 [Y]
How much will you bet?

```

Once you finish the basic version, add bonus features.

- The player should be able bet more after receiving the first two cards.
- Make the cards appear with proper frequency (10 is more likely than 2).
- Give the cards a suit by creating a card object.
- Make a version for two humans to play together.
- Anything else you think is cool
