A fancy UI is a must

Ravi Chung has a CAREER grant that is very similar to Ruzica, and a paper on live programming synthesis in PLDI and UIST.

Hieracrcy of liveness from some japanese guy - gives a way to quantify how 'live' your environment is

# Day 1

Remixing studies with program synthesis.
Constraint based programming as the ultimate remixing tool?

A literate community is not an illiterate community that can read

# Ravi Chung

Programming Language vs Direct Manipulation
programming good for prototyping, but direct manipulation good for prototyping

start with programming language and make it more 'directly manipulatable'

lambda calculus + direct manipulation (can i make a actual semantics for this?)
See PLDI 2016, fair bit of formalism there. Should look into that

Argun Guha - configuration files and program repair

# Thursday

At lunch

Talked to Korean guy from CMU about energy harvesting computing - opportunity for synthesis?

Servless Trilemma (IBM)

openwhisk, ibm-functions/composer on github
pure functions as a service
a way to compose functions
a real world, cloud deployed version of pure parallelism from haskell
black box, double billing, substitution (stuck with a tradeoff that you must violate one of these)
like CAP theoreom from databases?

Iota Calculus

A 'lambda calculus' for internet of things
