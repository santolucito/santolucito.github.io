QUOTE -----------------

Every day life forces you to make a trade - youth for experience. Make sure the barter the hell out of each day and take life for all its got.

In general youth for experience is a good trade. That experience can be a memory or a skill. Memeories ar ethe real treasure, but skill are not to be overlooked. Skills are very valuable because they lets you create more vivid memories or preserve those memories in a more imgainative way.

Also I have terrible gas right now.

amherst story board game

public class location
  public boolean checkTransition(Transition t, int roll, int turns){
   reutn (roll == t.roll && turnsElapsed > t.turnsWhenValid)

  public void MakeMove(int roll, int turn){
  int i = -1;
  while(!haveNextMove){
     i++;
     haveNextMove checkTransition(transitions[i], r, t);
  }
  makeTRansition(i);
  }

  transitions = [
   {roll=1,turns=0,message="Visit Alredia and Bob to play in their garden",image="path",destionation="Alread and bob"},
   {roll=2,turns=0,message="Go out back to Amhetyst Brook",image="path",destination="Amherstyst brook"},


IDEA -----------------
two worlds- dream vs physical


ludic dreaming
dream wizards control other dream people and war woith each ohter

you lucid dream when a dream wizard takes your whole town
everyone is a zombie and you have to fit in, otherwise you get "woken"

you learn to be a dream wizard and fight the other for the dream freedom of your friends

play the game in two modes, physical vs dreams
