# Creative Embedded Systems (Spring 2026)


Modules will be added as we go through the course.
You may find the [material from previous years](..) helpful as a guide.
Note that the course has been reworked from last year's iteration of the course.
As such, we will follow a different schedule, including in some cases covering different topics and assignments.
