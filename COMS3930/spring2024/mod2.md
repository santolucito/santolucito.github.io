# Assignment

## Interactive Devices (20 pts)

In this lab you will use your:

- ESP32 TTGO T-display
- a button
- a joystick
- a potentiometer

The goal is to create an interactive device with the provided hardware. 
The devices will run off wired power and send data back to your laptop for visualization, sonfication, or whatever media generation process you prefer.

From a hardware perspective, you will need to connect the specified components to the ESP32 and create an enclosure for the device.
From a software perspective, you will write an ESP32 program that collects sensor data and sends it over either a serial or wifi connection to a laptop.
You will also write a media generation program on your laptop to handle this data and create something interesting with it.

We will use a breadboard to connect all these components.

Deadline listed on courseworks

Submit a link to your blog post on the course blog. That post should contain:

### Project Specific Deliverables:

(8 pts total - see below for breakdown) 

A link to your git repository with a program that runs on the ESP32 TTGO T-Display, as well as the medi generation program (in a language of your choosing). The system must meet the following criteria:

(5 pts) Be interactive as discussed in class.
(2 pts) Utilize all three provided sensors.
(1 pts) Is in the spirit of the class as broadly interpreted by the instructors. Art is subjective, we want you to get comfortable with this ethos.

### Standard Documentation Deliverables:

(10 pts total - see below for breakdown)

In addition to the project specific deliverables lists above, you must also meet the following “standard documentation deliverables”. Throughout this course, we will ask you to document your work in order to slowly build a portfolio of your projects. Going forward, these types of standard documentation deliverables can be assumed to be required for all assignments unless specified otherwise.

(5 pts) A blog post

Using a blog site of your choice (github pages, hackaday, medium, notion, etc) make a blog post describing your art. The post should give an overview of your artistic vision. In particular for this assignment, you should address how you have specialized your generative art to the space. What creative decisions did you work lead you to, and which decisions did you take? How were your decisions motivated by your larger creative vision for this project. In the same vein, also address any technical issues you encountered in your work. Particularly focus on issues that other artists may encounter when developing with your hardware setup.

(3 pts) A README

On your github repo add a readme that contains a short description and key information on reproducibility/installation/usage. This key information should be sufficient for a knowledge third party, outside the class, to replicate your design. This readme can be a subset of the material used in your blog post.

(2 pts) Visual documentation of your art (and in this case, the installation as a whole)

Both your blog post and the README should have some amount of visual documentation.
Typically the blog post will have a video. 
The README can have some lighter weight visuals (e.g. a still image).
The video can be a simple video shot on your phone - assuming you use basic best practices as discussed in class. You can host the video wherever you like as long as the hosting platform supports in-browser playback (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo). You may also choose to embed a gif in your README in place of a video link.
