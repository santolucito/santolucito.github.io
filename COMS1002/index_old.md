# Computing in Context: Computing and the Arts

Key Learning Objectives:

- Write code to generate and manipulate multimedia
- Discuss issues of authorship in AI generated/assisted art
- Understand the various roles in computational art - who is the audience, who is the artist, who is the programmer?
- Contextualize computational art in its place. How is computational art presented, and how does that presentation changes its meaning?

Other learning objectives:

- Know resources to further explore areas of interest
- Understand key areas and issues in computational art
- Have the confidence to work with code in an array of artistic domains

## [Module 2: Audio](./2)

In this module we use Sonic Pi to explore live coding and audio.

<hr>

## [Module 3: Machine Learning](./3)

In this module we use the text-to-image model called Stable Diffusion, and learn to fine-tune machine learning models.

# FAQs

> Will any of this help me get a job?

Probably. In module 1, we work with processing.py. While our focus is on generative art, this is has significant amount of overlap in the skill set used for data visualization (for example, the gorgeous graphics produced by the New York Times on a daily basis). In module 2, we tackle live coding - the performative practice of writing code in front of an audience. While the art aspect of live coding may not be widely "marketable", having the confidence to write code on the spot (especially in front of people you want to impress - audience or employer) is critical to any tech job. In module 3, we work with machine learning - currently a hot topic in the job market. 

More generally, hopefully through this class you will come to realize that any experience that you gain with computing (in any context) will be broadly applicable to many paths to gainful employment. Computing is a mindset and way of thinking more so than it is a skill set.
