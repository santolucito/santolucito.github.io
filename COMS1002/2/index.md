# Module 2: Audio

### Project 2: Live coding with Sonic Pi

- Due Nov 23

Here we look at code as a performative interface. 
Looking beyond code as a fixed object, we find artistic value in the process of code evolution.
We explore experience of writing code in front of an audience and accepting imperfection.
In a more practical sense, this is particularly good training for coding interviews.

### Lecture 4: Live coding Ethos

We start be examining the design of languages around creativity - how does the structure of a programming language encourage exploration and creativity?
We then look at the practice of live coding and algoraves.
How can language design guide us to ensure code does not break on stage?
We ask - if code is art, what is virtuosity in code?
