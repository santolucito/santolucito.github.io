# Module 3: Physical Computing

Using the [micro:bit from BBC](https://microbit.org/), we will explore the basics of bringing computation to the physical world.
The micro:bit can be programmed with Python. 
We give an overview of the basic components of the micro:bit, and how to control them with code.
You will create a digital artifact that interfaces with non-technical users.
Here we pay particular attention to the importance of documentation.

Your goal is to create an interactive visualization that users can interact with using the microbit as a controller.
You will be interfacing your microbit with Processing in Python mode.
Use serial communication to send information from the microbit to the Processing running on your laptop.
This is again an open-ended assignment.

You should utilize at least two different sensors on the micro:bit (e.g. accelerometer and buttons) to send serial information.
Your Processing sketch should make use of these sensor values in a way that is central to the piece you are creating.

### What to hand in?

- Your program code for BOTH the micro:bit and processing in a .zip folder.
- Leave a comment on your courseworks submission with a link to the public posted video recording of you (or someone else) interacting with your processing sketch through the microbit. The video should capture both the visualization and the physical manipulation of the microbit.  The description field of the video should contain a short (at least 2 paragraphs, more if you like) write-up of the process you took in your work. You can think of this as an artist's statement. 

### How am I graded?

Rubric

- 50 points - Technical Sophistication. Does your project utilize your programming skills in an effective way? Have you gone significantly beyond any example code you have used? Is this "your" work?
- 30 points - Documentation. Have you captured your work in a digestible way? Does the documentation highlight both the artistic aspect of your work, as well as the technical sophistication? Your work should be equally well appreciated by both a technical and non-technical audience. Note that capturing the technical side is often the more difficult.
You will score full points by overlaying a screen capture of your processing sketch with a video of the microbit manipulation. If you take a video with your phone of your computer screen and the microbit manipulation you can score at most 28 points on this section.
- 20 points - Creativity. This is a subjective measure. You need to get comfortable with your work being judged in a subjective manner when working in Computing in Arts. To score full points here, submit a work that you are proud to call your own. Pursue something that is artistically motivating you, and communicate that through your documentation.

### Lecture 5: 
Dec 3

We give a basic overview of physical computing, the maker movement, etc.
How much background do you really need to build your own hardware device?
What are the various ways you can approach this?
What is the motivation for embedded systems, when should we just use a mobile phone?

### Lab 6: MicroBit setup

### Lecture 6: 

Dec 10

What is Digital Art in Place, and Place in Digital Art?
We explore issues of presentation of digital artifacts and how this can interface with strangers.
We ask: Where will this be displayed? What is the context in which it appears? What type of viewers consume this?
