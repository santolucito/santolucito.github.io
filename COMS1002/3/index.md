# Module 3: Physical Computing

### Project 3: micro:bit Art

- Due Dec 14

Using the [micro:bit from BBC](https://microbit.org/), we will explore the basics of bringing computation to the physical world.
The micro:bit can be programmed with Python. 
We give an overview of the basic components of the micro:bit, and how to control them with code.
You will create a digital artifact that interfaces with non-technical users.
Here we pay particular attention to the importance of documentation.

What is Digital Art in Place, and Place in Digital Art?
We explore issues of presentation of digital artifacts and how this can interface with strangers.
We ask: Where will this be displayed? What is the context in which it appears? What type of viewers consume this?
