# Module 1: Visuals

### Project 1: Processing

- Due Nov 9

Processing is an easy to use programming framework for creating visual arts.
We will use Processing in Python mode (processing.py) to create our own visual art with code.
During the creation process, some of the key questions we ask are:

- 
- How do we document our work accordingly to fully communicate our artistic intentions.

Technical aspects of visuals.
What is the difference between real-time vs offline graphics generation?
How do we understand performance bottlenecks and other basic issues in graphics systems?

### Lecture 2:

Nov 5

Creativity and Code. Context in digital art. 
How can code itself be a visual artistic object? Can we treat code as literature?
What are the core techniques used in generation of visuals.
How do we define the difference between data visualization and computational art?

How do we tackle issues of artistic ownership of art generated by an algorithm?
This is especially relevant in the machine learning setting, where training data was used in conjunction with code to generate new art.
