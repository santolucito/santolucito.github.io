# New Directions in Computing: Arts and Computing in NYC (Fall 2021)


The Arts and Computing in NYC course will be an intro level survey course for non Computer
Science majors to gain an appreciation for the cutting edge of the intersection between Computer
Science (CS) and the arts. Students will take away from the class an understanding of where the
future lies for the use of technology in a wide array for arts endeavors. Students will get
hands-on experience with the technologies used in various arts fields, such as computer music,
digital embroidery, and architectural preservation. The fundamentals of CS will be covered on an
as-needed basis to allow students to fully appreciate the tools they will use.

This is a **_joint institution_** course.
We will meet both on campus at Barnard College and on campus at Fashion Institute of Technology.
Students will need to travel to the respective campuses to attend lectures.
Below is a list of class locations throughout the semester

Many classes will feature guest lectures.
Such classes are indicated below.
When a guest lecturer is not indicated, the course will be co-taught be Prof. Mark Santolucito of Barnard College and Prof. Maria Hwang of FIT.
