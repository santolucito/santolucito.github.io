# Summary

This course will give an introduction to program synthesis, the process of writing programs that write programs. Program synthesis is an area of study at the intersection of programming languages, formal methods and AI. In this course we will focus on the programming languages and formal methods aspects of program synthesis. We will cover three types of program synthesis: 1) inductive synthesis (programming-by-example) 2) functional synthesis (synthesis from first order logic formulas) 3) reactive synthesis (synthesis from temporal logic formulas). For each unit we will ask three key questions: 1) What is the language interface used to specify the desired behavior of a program 2) How do we construct/find a program that both meets the specified behavior and is the program the user expected 3) How do we assist the user in writing a specification for synthesis This course will involve reading and discussing academic papers, using state-of-the-art program synthesis tools, and writing basic program synthesizers. These topics will require advanced logical reasoning/mathematics, as well as a solid understanding of programming language foundations. The course will feel something like a cross between discrete math and PLT.
