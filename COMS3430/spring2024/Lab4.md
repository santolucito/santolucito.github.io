# Lab 5 - Live Coding (12 pts)

## Part I (2 points)

Complete the "build your own live coding language" activity from class.
You start with the code here [https://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2021/liveCodePitch/](https://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2021/liveCodePitch/), and need to add one additional feature.
Examples of new features are given in the comments in the code for the example.

## Part II (10 points)

Participate in the algorave!

> Note!

Live coding is an improvisatory practice, but that does not mean it is without preparation.
Plan your piece ahead of time - have goals posts and/or a general sounds you will achieve throughout the piece planned out.


## Grading

6 points will be awarded for showing up to the algorave at your scheduled time.
4 points will be awarded based on the subjective evaluation of how well your performance embodies the Live Code Manifesto.
I recommend you spend at least 4 hours practicing live coding ahead of your recorded performance.

Making mistakes during your performance is okay.
This is live improvisatory work - it should not be perfect.
It should however communicate that you have adequately prepared.

## Submitting

You will submit a .zip file with 

1) index.html for Part I
2) main.js for Part I (possibly, multiple js files if you find that helpful)

You need to either upload a zip with all the files in it, or a link to an active website (not a github repo) with your live code language.
