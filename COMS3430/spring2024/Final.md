# Final Project (30 pts)

The final project should be turned in on Courseworks on May 9.

This project may be completed as a group of up to 3.
When working as a group, you must use a git repository to track each group members' commits and include a link to the repo in your submission.
Grades will be assigned as a group, and the final project is expected to be proportional to the number of group members.

The scope of this project should be 2.5 times as large as a homework assignment.
If you spent 10 hours on the homeworks on average, expect to spend 25 hours on this project.

If you are working as a group of 3, ~75 total effort-hours should be committed to this project.

This final project is 30 points - which is 30% of your grade.
No late work can be accepted for this final project.

## Proposal (2 pts)

Submit a write up describing your proposed project. 
Your write up should be at least two paragraphs, but can be longer if needed.
Use this opportunity to find the correct scope for your project.
I will provide feedback that is focused on the scope and feasibility of the proposed project based on the material we have covered so far and my overall sense of the fit of the proposed project to your preparation.

## Implementation (16 pts)

The final project is an open-ended project with (likely) WebAudio.

Broadly, your projects will fall into one of three categories, reflecting the three modules we have covered in class

1. Digital Signal Processing
2. Live Coding
3. Automated Composition

While your project will have a focus on one topic, it may require some combination of these topics.
You may use another language, but must consult with me 1-on-1 beforehand.
You may also do something else entirely.
Permission will only be granted under the circumstances of an exceptionally well thought-out project.

- Concepts from class: Apply one idea from class to your project. For example, the idea of FM synthesis, or focus on one point from the Live Code Manifesto. You do not need to replicate the concept exactly as used in class (although you can if you like). This confirms your comprehension of course material at a high level. (4 pts)
- Code techniques from class: At least one WebAudio technique covered in class should be used. E.g. using a gain node to control the index of modulation. This confirms your comprehension of course material on a low level implementation basis. (4 pts)
- Use of topic *not* covered in class: At least one technique that we have not covered in class should be used. This requires you to seek out knowledge on your own, and apply the understanding of computational sound you have gained in this class to a new setting. (4 pts)
- Quality of code. You should not have any copy-paste in your code. Your variable names should be sensible. Your functions should be short. Code should be appropriately commented. Etc, etc. Practice good development habits. (2 pts)
- Subjective measure: Have you completed a project that goes above and beyond expectations. This measures how well you have understood the nature of working in a creative domain such as computational sound and the inherently self-direct style of exploration it requires. (4 pts)

## Presentation (6 pts)

You will give submit a video demo of your work. 
Do a screencast with sound. You do not need to show your face, but you should be speaking and explaining the work.
Your presentations should be 4 minutes per group member, up to a maximum of 10 minutes.

## Write up (6 pts)

A blog post you are proud of detailing your implementation and design choices.
Your target audience for this blog post is someone outside of this class who is knowledgable about WebAudio and/or computational sound more broadly.
