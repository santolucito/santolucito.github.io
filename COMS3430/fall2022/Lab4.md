# Lab 4 - Live Coding (12 pts)

## Part I (2 points)

Complete the "build your own live coding language" activity from class.
You start with the code here [https://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2021/liveCodePitch/](https://www.marksantolucito.com/COMS3430/fall2021/liveCodePitch/), and need to add one additional feature.
Examples of new features are giving in the comments in the code for the example.

## Part II (10 points)

Make a video recording of yourself live coding.
You may use any live coding language listed here:

- Tidal (best for pattern based music)
- Sonic Pi (also good for pattern based music, easier syntax, but less expressive, harded to make complex rhytms. has good support for ```live_audio```)
- Quaver (basic of basic)
- SuperCollider (good for focus on DSP - see [http://marksantolucito.com/cpsc432.zip](http://marksantolucito.com/cpsc432.zip). very non-standard language model)
- Build-your-own 

Other languages may be used, but check with me first.

During your performance, you must:

- Code, live, in real-time
- Improvise, the piece cannot be completely planned ahead of time
- Demonstrate mastery of the language
- Generally, adhere to the [Live Code Manifesto](https://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft)

The performance must last at least 10 mins.
An exception applies if you are using a language you built yourself - in this case, the recording must last at least 2 mins (you will need enough content to still construct an arc through your performance).
The recording should include both recorded computer audio (directly from your soundcard - not a recording from your phone of your laptop speakers) and a screencast of your code as it evolves.

> Note!

Live coding is an improvisatory practice, but that does not mean it is without preparation.
Plan your piece ahead of time - have goals posts and/or a general sounds you will achieve throughout the piece planned out.


## Grading

6 points will be awarded for uploading a video of your code, with sound recorded directly from the computer.
4 points will be awarded based on the subjective evaluation of how well your performance embodies the Live Code Manifesto.
I recommend you spend at least 4 hours practicing live coding ahead of your recorded performance.

Making mistakes during your performance is okay.
This is live improvisatory work - it should not be perfect.
It should however communicate that you have adequately prepared.

## Submitting

You will submit a .zip file with at least 3 files

1) index.html for Part I
2) main.js for Part I (possibly, multiple js files if you find that helpful)
3) a video.txt file with a link to your video hosting on your favorite video publishing platform. The video does not need to be public, but I need to be able to access it.
