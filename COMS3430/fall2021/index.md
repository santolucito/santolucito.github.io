# Computational Sound (Fall 2021)


Modules will be added as we go through the course.
You may find the [material from last year](../fall2020) helpful as a guide.
Note that last year's iteration of the course was a 6-week intensive, so we will follow a different schedule, including in some cases covering different topics and assignments.

you can find the [syllabus here](./syllabus.pdf)
